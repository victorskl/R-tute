# tests

`tests` includes files to test your code to ensure that it is running properly throughout the development process. This folder can be created using the [testthat][1] R package. 

For large projects, especially, this is extremely useful because it allows you to quickly test to make sure that all of the functions that you write return the output that you expect of them.
